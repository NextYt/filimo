# Search Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of the search feature in the Filimo application. The search feature provides a modal that slides in from the right side of the screen, allowing users to search for movies and series in real-time.

## Features
- Slide-in animation from right to left
- Real-time search results as you type
- Debounced search to minimize API calls
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation (ESC to close)
- Beautiful UI with loading states and error handling

## Implementation Details

### 1. Search Context
- Located in `src/context/SearchContext.tsx`
- Manages the search state, including query, results, loading state, and modal visibility
- Provides a search function that filters content based on the query
- Implements debouncing to enhance performance

### 2. Search Modal Component
- Located in `src/components/SearchModal/SearchModal.tsx`
- Provides a responsive UI for the search functionality
- Renders search results in a grid layout
- Shows appropriate feedback for loading, no results, and initial state

### 3. CSS Styling
- Located in `src/style/searchModal.css`
- Implements animations for modal appearance
- Provides responsive styling for different screen sizes
- Styles for search results, loading states, and error messages

### 4. Header Integration
- Modified `src/components/Header/Header.tsx` to include search button functionality
- The search icon in the header now opens the search modal

## How It Works
1. User clicks the search icon in the header
2. The search modal slides in from the right with a smooth animation
3. As the user types, the search is performed in real-time (with debouncing)
4. Results are displayed in a grid with relevant information
5. Clicking a result navigates to the movie/series detail page
6. User can close the modal by clicking outside, pressing ESC, or clicking the close button

## Search Algorithm
The search functionality uses the ContentContext to access all movies and series data. It performs filtering based on:
- Movie/Series title
- English title
- Director name
- Categories

Results are presented in real-time as the user types, with duplicate entries removed.

## Future Improvements
- Add search history
- Implement advanced filters within the search modal
- Add voice search capability
- Improve search algorithm with fuzzy matching
- Add search analytics to track popular searches
